# Asymmetric Encryption Example

This demo app demonstrates the RSA algorithm. You can upload an image and encrypt it with a public key. Later you can decode it back, providing you have the corresponding private key. Unless you want to try your own keys, you can generate a pair of keys right on the page.

To test it make sure you have two windows/instances where one acts as the encrypting part while the other is the decrypting part.
